This app is a cookbook of different recipes. Every user can add up his/her own recipes. To do this one needs to register and to log in. 
After logging in You can see a link - "Add the recipe" - which shows You a form to fill in. 

The app allows users to sort recipes according to the type:
Salads,
Soups,
Cakes,
Cocktails,
Other.

Also after loggin in one can select only recipes added by himself/herself by pressing the link - "My recipes".
You can edit or delete Your own rescipes. 

To build this app I used MEAN stack - MongoDB, Express.js, Angular and Node.js. I deployed my app on the cloud platform Heroku and for storing data I used MongoDB hosting platform MongoLab.
